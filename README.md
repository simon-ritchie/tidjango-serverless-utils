# tidjango-serverless-utils

Various utility library for TiDB Serverless on Django.

# Notes

- Currently, TiDB Serverless is compatible with MySQL 5.7, so this library supports Django v4.1.x (v4.2.x or later version supports MySQL 8.x or later version).
  - If TiDB Serverless supports MySQL 8.x in the future, this library will likely also be updated accordingly.
